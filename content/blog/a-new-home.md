I've been contemplating building a new personal website for over a year now.

At first, I had a lot of design ideas, but the final result is a very simple page. This time, I have added
a blog to write down my thoughts and experiences along the way. My old website is still available for
anyone who's interested https://hecticme.pages.dev

It has been two years since I decided to drop everything to study programming. Much has happened, which also
came with growth. Yet, doubt and fear still occasionally creep in. The uncertainty of the future strangles
me with anxiety. I just hope that I can see the end of it someday.

Anyway, this is my new home. Let's see where the road leads me to :)
